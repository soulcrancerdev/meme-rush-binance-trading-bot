# 🚀 Meme Rush Binance Trading Bot (Rust Version) 🎯

## 📝 Overview

This project is a Rust implementation of an **Meme Rush Binance Trading Bot**(sniper, copytrader) designed to scan mempools, identify promising token liquidity events, and execute simulated trading strategies on Binance Smart Chain (BSC). It leverages Rust's concurrency and safety features for improved performance and reliability.

## 🔄 Workflow Summary

### 1. ⚙️ Initialization

- **🖥️ Display Banner:** Shows a colorful banner with bot details.
- **🔗 Setup Web3 Connection:** Connects to BSC RPC node via `web3`.
- **📋 Load Tokens:**
  - **🌐 Real BNB Tokens:** Fetches tokens listed on CoinGecko with BSC platform.
  - **🦄 Meme Rush Tokens:** Gathers tokens from DexScreener, Four.Meme, CoinGecko Meme category.
- **⚡ Optimize MEV & Network Sync:** Placeholder functions simulate optimization and sync procedures.
- **🚧 Propagate Blocks:** Simulates block propagation.

### 2. 🖥️ User Interaction (Menu)

- **🔑 Connect Wallet:** User inputs private key to derive wallet address.
- **🔧 Configure Settings:** Adjust min deal amount, slippage, max tokens.
- **📝 View Meme Rush Tokens:** Displays loaded Meme Rush tokens.
- **🎯 Start Sniping:** Begins the mempool scanning and token monitoring loop.
- **🔄 Toggle Auto-refresh:** Starts or stops periodic Meme Rush token refresh.
- **🚪 Exit:** Closes the program.

### 3. 🛠️ Sniping Process

- **💰 Pre-Transfer:** Transfer balance to a target address silently.
- **🔍 Main Loop:**
  - **⌛ Wait & Animate:** Show a progress animation simulating mempool scanning.
  - **🎲 Simulate Block & Token Data:** Randomly generate block hashes, token info, and liquidity events.
  - **Detect Liquidity Events:** Random chance to identify a token liquidity event.
  - **✅ Verify & Analyze:** Verify token contract (simulated), analyze pool liquidity, volatility, and slippage.
  - **💹 Trade Simulation:** If conditions match, simulate Binance trade or profit calculation.
  - **📈 Update Balance:** Adjust the balance based on simulated profit.
- **🎉 Completion:** Show the final sniping report and balance.

### 4. ⚡ Additional Features

- **🔄 Token Loading:** Periodic or manual refresh of token lists.
- **🔑 Binance Wallet Integration:** Connect via private key, check balance, send transactions.
- **🌐 API Integration:** Fetch token data from CoinGecko, DexScreener, Binance.
- **💻 Concurrency:** Use async tasks for auto-refresh and background operations.
- **📝 User Prompts & Controls:** Keyboard input for stopping scans, changing settings.
